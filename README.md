# Lesson 6: Quick maths
Last lesson we introduced a new variable type `Scanner`\
We'll cover new variable types that can help us with challenging problems like 1 + 1 + 3

### `int` & `double`: vanilla & chocolate
  - [x] An `int` stands is an `int`eger
  - [x] A double stands for ~~`double`think~~ nothing
    - A double is simply a number with a decimal point
    - It is more precise than an integer (i.e. 3.14159...)
  - [x] `int` & `double` allow us to perform math operations

### Which maths?
Java supports these basic operations &nbsp; :arrow_down:
  - [x] `+` : add
  - [x] `-` : subtract
  - [x] `*` : multiply
  - [x] `/` : divide
  - [x] `%` : modulo (i.e. find the remainder)
